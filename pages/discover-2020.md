 <b>Build Them Up! Teach Children Digital Literacy Through Play</b><br>
<b>4.00pm to 5.00pm, Saturday, 28 November 2020</b><br>
The use of technology has allowed parents and children to be increasingly linked through the proliferation of apps, channels and platforms. This necessity to be online also presents a new set of issues for parents, such as difficulty in engaging their children on digital literacy topics due to their intangibility. Research by Kapersky has shown that parents spend just 46 minutes talking to their children about online risks throughout their entire childhood as they find it difficult to express the risks in a relatable way.<br> 
To enable children to maximise the immense learning and development benefits that can be achieved through digital experiences, it is equally important for children to be educated on the associated risks of online experiences and how to navigate the online environment in a safe manner.  By using creative and play-based techniques to bring these concepts to life, kids will have a better understanding of what to look out for when they navigate the internet to be safe, be smart and be kind.<br> 
This webinar, presented by the LEGO Group and the Media Literacy Council, will provide insights to how technology has changed parent’s and children’s digital literacy habits, practical tips, and activities for parents and educators to engage children on digital literacy and safety topics through playful experiences.
